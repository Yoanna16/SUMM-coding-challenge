# Countries Page

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking the SUMM front-end developer challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You should use React for this. You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- You do **not** have to implement the toggle button between light and dark mode

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

- Try to commit as you would do in a professional setting because the commits will be reviewed
- Use code / React best practices
- Use functional components
- Use JavaScript ES6+ and optional TypeScript for this project
- Bonus: Test your code
- Have fun while coding, do not overthink everything :)
